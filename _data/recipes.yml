    PEN15 is middle school as it really happened. Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle
    star in this adult comedy, playing versions of themselves as
    thirteen-year-old outcasts in the year 2000, surrounded by actual
    thirteen-year-olds, where the best day of your life can turn into your worst
    with the stroke of a gel pen.
